## Description 

Melody is a grid based theme templated for general website use.Melody is a ClassicPress theme designed to approach a concept on how to make page building a more user-friendly and SEO (page speed load time) friendly process.

Page builders take up a lot of bandwidth and are sometimes filled with lots of excessive code that just slows down your website. 
So we attempt to eleminate over-bloat of code by using built in components of WordPress that are already part of its core functionality.

You can use a custom Landing page template to arrange widget on the page which help in building typical page sections, without knowing code.
