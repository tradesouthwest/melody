<li>Melody is designed to approach a concept on how to make page building a more user-friendly and SEO (page speed load time) friendly process. 
    Page builders take up a lot of bandwidth and are sometimes filled with lots of excessive code that just slows down your website. 
    So we attempt to eleminate over-bloat of code by using built in components of WordPress that are already part of its core functionality. 

    We use widgets to allow you to inset just about any content type into the lower part of your normal content. Curently there is a limit to the 
    number of available widgets that come with Melody but we will add sectional widgets---as a plugin---as time goes by.

Or use it to add plain text and bits of HTML to the lower section of the page.</li>
